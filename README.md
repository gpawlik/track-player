## ðŸ’¡ Key Decisions

- **Chosing `react-native-track-player`**: For simpler and cleaner queue management and native feeling (compared to eg. `expo-av`)
- **State Management with Redux**: Ensures predictable behavior and scalable state handling, specially in combination with `redux-saga`
- **Expo Managed Workflow**: Simplifies development and deployment.
- **Testing**: Focused on Redux logic and utils testing using Jest.

---

## ðŸ§© Challenges

- **Finding a decent free API for the audio content**: Most of the APIs offer only 30 seconds preview and the artworks are low quality
- **Making `react-native-track-player` work with Expo**: The new architecture is not yet supported in the newest version of RNTP
- **Creating a smooth "scrubber" component**: Needed to find a balance betwen the performance and visual sensation of a smotth movement
